      "Oil-based drilling fluids are used extensively in drilling activities worldwide. During the drilling process, because of overbalance pressure in the mud column, the filtrate of oil-based mud invades the formation. This hydrocarbon-based filtrate mixes with the formation hydrocarbon, which can cause major difficulties in obtaining a representative reservoir-fluid sample. Despite the recent improvements in sampling, obtaining a contamination-free formation fluid is a major challenge, particularly in openhole wells.\n",
      "Depending on the type and conditions of the reservoir, the oil-based-mud filtrate is totally or partially miscible with the formation fluid. Oil-based-mud filtrate dissolves completely in reservoir oil; therefore, the captured sample contains the true reservoir oil with added filtrate. Gas condensate (lean gas condensate in particular) is often not fully miscible with mud filtrate. In this case, the mass exchange between gas condensate and mud filtrate makes the sample unrepresentative of the reservoir fluid.\n",
      "In this study, the impact of sample contamination with oil-based-mud filtrate on different types of reservoir fluids, including gas condensate and volatile-oil samples, is investigated. Two simple methods are suggested to retrieve the uncontaminated composition from a contaminated sample in which mud filtrate is totally dissolved in the formation fluid (i.e., reservoir-oil samples). A tracer-based technique is also developed to determine the composition of an uncontaminated reservoir-fluid sample from a sample contaminated with oil-based-mud filtrate, particularly for those cases in which the two fluids are partially miscible. The tracers are added to the drilling fluid, with the additional cost to the drilling-mud preparation being negligible. The capability of the developed techniques has been examined against deliberately contaminated reservoir-fluid samples under controlled conditions in the laboratory. The results indicate the reliability of the proposed methods.\n"

      "['We are sorry, but we are experiencing unusual traffic at this time. Please help us confirm that you are not a robot and we will take you to your content.\\n\\nCould not validate captcha. Please try again.', 'Carbonated water injection has gained wide interest as an enhanced oil recovery technique. The efficiency of oil displacement during an ordinary waterflood is dictated and governed mainly by the viscous and capillary forces between oil and water. These forces are controlled by the interfacial tension (IFT) between the fluids and the contact angle (CA) with the rock surface. In this study, the pendant drop technique and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were combined to investigate the effect of adding carbon dioxide on the water/oil/rock interfaces. CA measurement is rather a macroscopic assessment of the wettability while molecular simulation can provide further microscopic insights. The multiscale approach involves direct wettability assessment of asphaltene-containing oil against pure water or carbonated water, both exposed to two types of carbonate rock samples. Molecular characterization of asphaltenes was carried out by analytical means and different asphaltene structures were recreated on a computational platform for asphaltene-water and asphaltene-carbonated water molecular simulations. The experimental data revealed that the carbonated water caused the CA to change from weakly oil-wet to intermediate to water-wet wettability. Molecular simulation was invoked to shed more light into the underlying mechanisms behind the observed wettability alteration. In particular, molecular simulation of IFT and asphaltene swelling effect driven by the interactions with carbon dioxide were analyzed. The results were found consistent with the experiments. The findings presented in this paper highlight the viability of carbonated water for enhanced oil recovery and provide in-depth insights into the underlying mechanisms.', 'We are sorry, but we are experiencing unusual traffic at this time.

Please try again.', 'Temporary plugging and diverting fracturing of the horizontal well is the primary option to promote production for tight reservoirs. Successful entry of diverters into the perforation is the basis and prerequisite for effective plugging. However, the transport behavior of the diverter during multicluster fracturing remains unclear. In this paper, we build a large-scale diverter transport experimental system, capable of conducting experiments with large flow rates and high pressures. The concerned factors include the injection rate, perforation flow ratio (PFRO), fluid viscosity, and perforation angle. The results show that the diverter transport effect is significantly different because of different flow distribution among perforations. Also, the diverter can enter the perforation only when the flow rate of the perforation reaches a certain value. In addition, the minimum critical PFRO has an “oblique L-shaped” relationship with the injection rate. Although it is difficult for the diverter to enter the perforation on the high side of the horizontal wellbore, increasing the viscosity of the carrying fluid or using a multidensity mixed diverter can effectively solve this problem. Furthermore, the field case shows that the experimentally obtained diverter transport pattern can be applied to the field to predict the location of the diverter and improve the temporary plugging effect. The findings of this work lay a theoretical foundation for subsequent temporary plugging and diverting fracturing control.', 'We are sorry, but we are experiencing unusual traffic at this time.

Furthermore, injectivity associated with the viscous polymer solutions must not be reduced to where fluid throughput in the reservoir and oil production rates become uneconomic. Fractures with limited length and proper orientation have been theoretically argued to dramatically increase polymer injectivity and eliminate polymer mechanical degradation. This paper confirms these predictions through a combination of calculations, laboratory measurements, and field observations (including step-rate tests, pressure transient analysis, and analysis of fluid samples flowed back from injection wells and produced from offset production wells) associated with the Kalamkas oil field in Western Kazakhstan. A novel method was developed to collect samples of fluids that were back-produced from injection wells using the natural energy of a reservoir at the wellhead. This method included a special procedure and surface-equipment scheme to protect samples from oxidative degradation. Rheological measurements of back-produced polymer solutions revealed no polymer mechanical degradation for conditions at the Kalamkas oil field. An injection well pressure falloff test and a step-rate test confirmed that polymer injection occurred above the formation parting pressure. The open fracture area was high enough to ensure low flow velocity for the polymer solution (and consequently, the mechanical stability of the polymer). Compared to other laboratory and field procedures, this new method is quick, simple, cheap, and reliable. Tests also confirmed that contact with the formation rapidly depleted dissolved oxygen from the fluids—thereby promoting polymer chemical stability.', 'We are sorry, but we are experiencing unusual traffic at this time.

However, the amount of entrapped gas, which is more meaningful for engineering, is rarely involved. In this paper, a theoretical model for calculating the maximum gas entrapment concentration (MGEC) is established for the first time. The critical distance between horizontal and vertical entrapped bubbles was determined by the yielded region caused by the buoyancy and the coupled stress field around the multiple bubbles. The MGEC is the ratio of a single bubble volume to its domain volume, which is calculated from the distance between the vertical and the horizontal bubbles. By comparing with the experimental results, the average error of MGEC calculated by this model is 4.42%, and the maximum error is 7.32%. According to the prediction results of the model, an empirical equation that can be conveniently used for predicting MGEC is proposed.', 'We are sorry, but we are experiencing unusual traffic at this time.

Acoustic/vibrational telemetry has been of keen interest because it is so far the only method that allows a high data transfer rate as well as less data loss, over other methods. The method certainly depends on the use of the right communication tools and efficient communication schemes to achieve the highest data transfer rate. Although the acoustic method provides a very high data transmission rate, it also has its limitations. However, limitations can be overcome through certain approaches and the use of technologies. The proper use of a communication device with the steel pipe is the most important factor to consider so that the transducer works as the right actuator for the pipeline. The type of sensor that is used to pick up the data also plays a major role because signals are most likely to attenuate, and a sensitive sensor is necessary to collect these attenuated signals. This research demonstrates the use of a transducer as a communication device and oil and gas pipe as the medium of data transmission. The transducer can be used both as an actuator driver and as a receiver sensor. A new piezoelectric transducer was manufactured for this research, which was used with a test setup of a total 184 ft length of six oil and gas pipes. The test setup performed well and data were sent through this setup successfully. A communication scheme is developed using novel theories to achieve the highest data transfer rate. The scheme is tested with the transfer function data obtained from the experimental system. The communication scheme developed outputs a signal, which is a type of binary phase-shift keying signal data along with an equalizer filter. Then the signals developed from the scheme are used in the actual experimental setup to test the speed of the transmission and bit error rate (BER). For the six oil and gas pipes setup, the scheme provides a data transmission of 153 bits/sec (bps) with zero error percentage, which is high enough to use in any oil and gas industry.', 'Multistage plug and perforation (plug-n-perf) fracturing is commonly used for horizontal well completion in unconventional reservoirs. Uniform distribution of proppant across all clusters in each stage has proved to be challenging with low viscosity slickwater owing to its limited transport capability. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used to model proppant transport in wellbore to improve perforation and fracturing design for achieving uniform proppant placement. However, traditional CFD modeling of a full-scale stage is computationally expensive, which limits its applicability in the completion design optimization. A new approach was developed in this paper to efficiently predict proppant placement along a multicluster stage based on a machine learning (ML) model trained with extensive CFD modeling results. Its high computational efficiency permits quick sensitivity analyses to optimize perforation and fracturing designs. The new approach was validated against full-stage CFD modeling results as well as post-treatment field diagnostics. Sensitivity analyses show that proppant inertia effect is a key factor affecting proppant placement in heel clusters with higher slurry flow rates, allowing more proppant carried to the toe owing to its higher density in comparison with fluid. Proppant settling allows bottom perforations to accept more proppant than top perforations. This gravitational effect is not negligible near the heel at high flow rates and becomes more dominant near toe clusters where the flow rate is reduced. Near-uniform proppant placement is achievable via perforation design optimization by taking advantage of these two key mechanisms controlling proppant transport in horizontal wellbores. It is demonstrated that in-line perforating designs with all perforations having the same orientation in each cluster or the entire stage, especially with perforations at the bottom or on the side of the wellbore, improve the proppant placement uniformity. However, it is recommended that the optimum perforation design should be identified case by case depending on specific input parameters. The ML-based model developed in this study has overcome some of the limitations from existing models in the literature and is able to provide quick and yet reliable solutions to proppant placement prediction and design optimization.', 'Understanding fracture height growth can be of great significance to optimizing field development and improving recovery. The Hydraulic Fracturing Test Site 2 (HFTS-2) has provided a unique opportunity and an advanced data set to allow us to observe and understand fracture geometries rigorously. Low-frequency distributed acoustic sensing (LF-DAS) data from a vertical well in HFTS-2 showed three key observations: (i) excessive upward height growth (>1,000 ft) and limited downward growth of the hydraulic fractures during pumping, (ii) considerable additional upward fracture height growth (~300 ft) after well shut in, and (iii) very complex LF-DAS strain rate patterns for a small fiber-to-stage offset. Advanced geomechanical modeling was performed to simulate the hydraulic fracture propagation and the resulting strain responses in the vertical direction. The modeling results demonstrated asymmetric upward and downward fracture height growths as observed in HFTS-2 with a similar upward height growth rate. Simulated waterfall plots of vertical strain rate showed distinct patterns for different fiber-to-fracture distances. The upward-growing fracture tip can be clearly identified by the interfaces between compressing and extending zones. It was also found that the complex strain rate patterns observed in HFTS-2 for small fiber-stage offsets were not caused by the mechanical layering but possibly result from the simultaneous propagation of multiple hydraulic fractures at different rates. The simulation results improved the understating of the HFTS-2 LF-DAS data, and the simulated strain rate patterns could also serve as templates for fracture height interpretation from LF-DAS data in future.', 'We are sorry, but we are experiencing unusual traffic at this time.

The model is driven by not only labeled data, but also scientific theories, including governing equations, boundary and initial conditions, and expert knowledge. Two independent neural networks (NNs) are built in the TgNN for oil/water phase flow problems, with one approximating pressure and the other approximating saturation. The two networks are connected by loss functions, which include a data mismatch term, as well as theory-guided terms. The desired parameters in NNs are trained by a certain optimization algorithm to decrease the value of the loss function. The training process uses a two-stage strategy as follows: (1) after one of the two NNs obtains a satisfactory result, parameters in the network with better performance are fixed in calculating the nonlinear terms and (2) the other NN continues to be trained until satisfactory performance is also obtained. The proposed TgNN offers an effective way to solve the coupled nonlinear two-phase flow problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed TgNN achieves better accuracy than the traditional deep neural network (DNN). This is because the governing equation can constrain spatial and temporal derivatives, and other physical constraints (i.e., boundary and initial conditions, expert knowledge) can make the outputs more scientifically consistent. The effect of sparse data (including labeled data and collocation points) is tested, and the results show that more labeled data and collocation points lead to improved long-term prediction performance. However, the TgNN can also be successfully trained in the absence of labeled data by merely adhering to the above-mentioned scientific theories. In addition, several more complicated scenarios are tested, including the existence of data noise, changes in well condition, transfer learning, and the existence of different levels of dynamic capillary pressure. Compared with the traditional DNN, TgNN possesses superior stability with the guidance of theories for the considered complex situations.', 'We are sorry, but we are experiencing unusual traffic at this time.

Modeling coupled fluid flow and mechanical deformation in fractured reservoirs relies on either sophisticated gridding techniques or enhancing the variables (degrees of freedom) that represent the physics to describe the behavior of fractured formation accurately. The objective of this study is to develop a spatial discretization scheme that cuts the “matrix” grid with fracture planes and utilizes traditional formulations for fluid flow and geomechanics.\\n\\nThe flow model uses the standard low-order finite volume method with the compartmental embedded discrete fracture model (cEDFM). Due to the presence of nonstandard polyhedra in the grid after cutting/splitting, we use numerical harmonic shape functions within a polyhedral finite element (PFE) formulation for mechanical deformation. To enforce fracture-contact constraints, we use a penalty approach.\\n\\nWe provide a series of comparisons between the approach that uses conforming unstructured grids and an unstructured discrete fracture model (uDFM) with the new cut-cell PFE formulation. The manuscript validates and compares both methods for linear elastic, single-fracture slip, and Mandel’s problems with tetrahedral, Cartesian, and perpendicular-bisectional (PBI) grids. Finally, the paper presents a fully coupled 3D simulation with multiple inclined intersecting faults activated in shear by fluid injection, which caused an increase in effective reservoir permeability.\\n\\nOur approach allows for great reduction in the complexity of the (gridded) model construction while retaining the solution accuracy together with great savings in the computational cost compared with uDFM. The flexibility of our model with respect to the types of grid polyhedra allows us to eliminate mesh artifacts in the solution of the transport equations typically observed when using tetrahedral grids and two-point flux approximation.', 'We are sorry, but we are experiencing unusual traffic at this time.

As the fundamental basis of related research on iron sulfides, an accurate thermodynamic model for iron sulfide solubility prediction under wide ranges of conditions (e.g., water compositions, temperature, pressure, and pH) is required. In this study, a plug flow reactor was built to measure iron sulfide solubility at various temperatures (25–90°C), pH (5.9–6.9), and ionic strength (0.150–4.27 mol/kg). Using the mackinawite solubility data measured in this study and in literature, a new Pitzer theory-based thermodynamic model with the explicit presence of ion complexes was developed. In this model, a neutral aqueous ion complex, FeS aq , was included explicitly. The mackinawite solubility product constant was fitted with a temperature-dependent equation from 23 to 125°C: p K s p , m = − 94.97 + 4 , 444 T K + 14.64 × l n ( T K ) \\u2060, with TK as temperature in Kelvin. This model can accurately predict the mackinawite solubility with standard error of estimate (SEE) of the mean SI = ±0.015 SI units, under wide ranges of temperature (23–125°C), pH (3.16–9.66), ionic strength (0–5 mol/kg water), and Fe(II) to S(-II) molar ratio (from 1:1,000 to 10,000:1). The Gibbs free energy and enthalpy of formation for mackinawite were also derived. This new model could help improve FeS scaling and corrosion control in complicated industrial systems, as well as the sulfide-related heavy metal transport in natural aqueous systems.', 'We are sorry, but we are experiencing unusual traffic at this time.

However, the abnormal pressure of offshore reservoirs is more common compared with terrestrial oil and gas reservoirs, and the marine geological structure is complex, with the development of faults, fractures, and high and steep structures, which leads to the strong anisotropy of formation pore pressure distribution and uncertainty of pressure system change. In this paper, considering the corresponding characteristics of the randomness of the formation pressure prediction results in the Eaton equation for their respective variables, a formation pressure inversion method based on multisource information, such as predrilling data, bottomhole while drilling data, seabed measured data, and surface measured data, is established. On this basis, combined with the data of a well in the South China Sea, the variation law of the uncertainty of formation pressure prediction results under the conditions of predrilling data, measurement while drilling (MWD) data, and their mutual coupling is analyzed. The simulation results show that the uncertainty distribution of formation pressure prediction based solely on predrilling data shows linear accumulation trend with well depth, and the formation pressure inversion method based on multisource information can significantly curb the increasing trend of uncertainty when MWD data are introduced. Therefore, through the analysis of typical change patterns of monitoring parameters under normal/abnormal conditions during drilling, combined with the method of multisource information, the abnormal pressure information can be accurately predicted and inversed, which provides important support for wellbore pressure regulation under complex formation conditions.', 'Monitoring of production rates is essential for reservoir management, history matching, and production optimization. Traditionally, such information is provided by multiphase flowmeters or test separators. The growth of the availability of data, combined with the rapid development of computational resources, enabled the inception of digital techniques, which estimate oil, gas, and water rates indirectly. This paper discusses the application of continuous deep learning models, capable of reproducing multiphase flow dynamics for production monitoring purposes. This technique combines the time evolution properties of a dynamical system and the ability of neural networks to quantitively describe poorly understood multiphase phenomena and can be considered as a hybrid solution between data-driven and mechanistic approaches. The continuous latent ordinary differential equation (Latent ODE) approach is compared with other known machine learning methods, such as linear regression, ensemble-based model, and recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, the framework of virtual flowmetering (VFM) is analyzed from the point of multiphase measurement technology.\\n\\nIn this work, the application of Latent ODEs for the problem of multiphase flow rate estimation is introduced. The considered example refers to a scenario in which the topside oil, gas, and water flow rates are estimated using the data from several downhole pressure sensors. The predictive capabilities of different types of machine learning and deep learning instruments are explored using simulated production data from a multiphase flow simulator.\\n\\nThe results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the continuous deep learning models in comparison with other machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, where the normalized root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of prediction below 5% were achieved. While Latent ODE demonstrates the significant time required to train the model, it outperforms other methods for irregularly sampled time series, which makes it especially attractive to forecast values of multiphase rates.', 'We are sorry, but we are experiencing unusual traffic at this time.

Please try again.', 'Aeolian deposits are typically considered to act as homogeneous “tanks” of sand, which do not contain significant heterogeneities that impact the production of hydrocarbons. However, a succession of deeply buried aeolian gas reservoirs from the Permian Rotliegend exhibit a characteristic production decline profile that is typified by high initial flow rates, followed by a rapid decline in bottomhole pressure and decline in flow rate, subsequently followed by stabilization at low flow rates for an extended period (over several decades). This effect has been termed here as the “slow-gas effect,” and this production phenomenon has previously been attributed to structural compartmentalization.\\n\\nThis paper presents an alternative, sedimentological hypothesis for the cause of the slow-gas effect based upon facies-controlled permeability differences within aeolian dune trough architectures. To test this, three interwell (km) scale models from well-studied aeolian analogs from Utah and Arizona were modeled with standard geostatistical reservoir techniques and populated with petrophysical properties from producing Rotliegend reservoirs in Germany. These models were subsequently dynamically simulated to analyze production behavior and test whether a similar “slow-gas” production profile could be reproduced.\\n\\nThis study finds that the slow-gas effect primarily results from heterogeneities created by the complex interaction of deposition, accumulation, and erosion within aeolian strata, as opposed to the structural compartmentalization of homogeneous tanks of sand as previously thought. Structural compartmentalization and baffling through faulting where present will have an impact on fluid flow; however, it is not considered here to be the primary cause of the slow-gas effect. Results of this work demonstrate the necessity of accurately characterizing and reproducing low permeability heterogeneity in aeolian systems. These heterogeneities can either be modeled explicitly through the use of geostatistical reservoir modeling techniques as done here, or implicitly through the use of characteristic length and transmissibility multipliers. These results have significant implications on our understanding of how tight aeolian systems produce; namely, after depletion of the near-wellbore volume, production from the surrounding reservoir is baffled by a hierarchy of low permeability bounding surfaces and associated transmissibility barriers. Application for enhancing reservoir depletion strategies include optimizing well trajectories to maximize the number of dune penetrations and percentage of net reservoir facies in communication to the well; maximizing the size of the primary reservoir compartment. Neighboring wells should be placed in separate compartments to maximize the amount of fast-flowing gas production during the early production stage. Pressure management can be used to cyclically produce, deplete, and recharge the primary reservoir compartment to manage and optimize recovery during the decline phase and production tail.', 'The leaching of a salt cavern will trigger a series of rock-fluid interactions, including salt rock dissolution, cavity expansion, and brine transport caused by convection, turbulence, and diffusion effects. These interactions have influences on one another. The primary objectives of this study include developing a 3D multiphysical coupled model for horizontal salt cavern leaching and quantifying these interactions. The species transport equation and standard κ-ε equation were combined to describe the brine transport dynamics within the cavity. Based on the velocity and concentration distribution characteristics predicted, the interface movement equation implemented with mesh deformation techniques was applied to describe the cavity expansion. Next, the Volgograd cavern monitored data were collected for model validation. The predicted results are consistent with the field data. The average relative errors are 11.0% for brine displacing concentration and 4.5% for cavity volume. The results suggest that the cavity can be divided into three regions, including the main flow region, circulation region, and reflux region. The results also suggest that the brine concentration distribution is relatively uniform. With the dissolution threshold angle and anisotropic dissolution rates considered, the resultant cavity cross section is crown top and cone bottom. The results also show that the cavity can be divided into dissolution and erosion sections according to its position relative to the injection point.', 'Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) storage and sequestration is regarded as an effective approach to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. While injecting an enormous amount of CO 2 into carbonate-rich aquifers, CO 2 dissolves in the formation brine under the large pressure and the subsequently formed CO 2 -enriched brine reacts with the calcite. Reaction-induced changes in pore structure and fracture geometry alter the porosity and permeability, giving rise to the concerns of CO 2 storage capacity and security. Especially in the reservoir or aquifer with natural fractures, the fractures provide highly permeable pathways for fluid flow. This study aims to analyze the acid-rock interaction and subsequent permeability evolution in the systems with complex fracture configurations during CO 2 injection by implementing a pore-scale Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes (DBS) reactive transport model. The model has been developed by expanding the functionality of OpenFOAM, which is an open-source code for computational fluid dynamics. A series of partial differential equations are discretized by applying the finite volume method and then solved sequentially. Different fracture configurations, such as fracture length, density, connection, and mineral components, have been considered to investigate their impacts on the dynamic porosity-permeability relationship, dissolution rate, and reactant transport characteristics during CO 2 storage. Various mineralogical compositions were investigated to compare their effects on the reactive transport and subsequent system behavior induced by water-rock interactions. The investigation revealed several interesting findings. We found that calcium (Ca) ions concentration was low in the poorly connected area at the initial time. Because CO 2 -enriched brine saturated the system and reacted with calcite, Ca ions started accumulating in the system. However, Ca ions barely flowed out of the poorly connected area, and the concentration became high. Lengths of branches mainly influenced the dissolution rates, while they had slight impacts on the porosity-permeability relationship. While fracture connectivity had an apparent influence on the porosity-permeability relationship, it showed a weak relevance on the dissolution rate. The calcite-clay fracture-matrix system showed a slow increase of permeability because CO 2 -enriched brine was injected. These microscopic insights can help enhance the CO 2 sealing capacity to guarantee environmental safety.']\n"
